                                    On this page I will be documenting the process I went through when working on project 3 in the course VÉL403G at the University of Iceland. This project was similar to project 2 in the same course but now I was working with a 3D printer rather than a laser cutter. <br>
                                    The first part of the project was to measure a constraint of a 3D printer. A constraint is just a limit on the type of geometry a 3D printer can produce. <br>
                                    The second part of the project was to print an object that could not be manufactured by conventional methods. <br>
                                    And the last part was to scan an object in 3D using a software. <br>
                                    The design files can be found in this <a href=Project%203%20-%20files.zip>link</a>.

                                <p>
                                     For the constraint test I worked with my fellow students: <a href="https://arnorbreki.github.io/project1/index.html?fbclid=IwAR0N-r30GZe783i3jDrdJQNkCE663UczVtGzn_J2gx9capyP4rmew12oo6o">Arnór Breki Ásþórsson</a>, <a href="https://halldorgauti.github.io/vefsida/">Halldór Gauti Pétursson</a> and <a href="https://valgeir99.github.io/valgeir/?fbclid=IwAR0VupQyBD0ayfxEOueKPXgaDTJXI27CYiK09MlyOU9RmPHJ4SSRGxayK6A">Valgeir Einarsson</a>. The test we did was a mini version of a test that Hafliði recommended in one of his lectures. Further description of the test can be found on Valgeir’s page<a href="https://valgeir99.github.io/valgeir/3d_printing.html">(link to constraint test)</a>.

									<h3>3D printing</h3>
								</header>
                                <p>
                                   This is the second iteration of the 3D printing aspect project 3. I will be designing a 3D printed object, with the results from the restraint test in mind. The object I decided on designing was a simple mount with a hook for my jacket and pins to rest my keys. I designed the object in Fusion 360 and spliced it in Cura. Since I do not have the time to print out the object, the slicing of the object in Cura will be the last step. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The first step of the process was to make the base. I did that by making a rectangle sketch and rounding off the corners. I played around with the dimensions a bit until I liked the general shape of the base.

                                         </p>  
                                         
                                    <center> 
                                    <br>
                                    <a  class=""><img src="Myndir%203dprent/base1.png" alt="" width= "400" /><img src="Myndir%203dprent/base2.png" alt="" width= "400" /></a>
                                    </center>
                                         <br>
                                         <p>
                                        Once I had that sketch I extruded the base and put a fillet on all of the edges on the top side. Then I started making some construction lines to make the hook and the pins. All were made with simple rectangles.

                                         </p>
                                         
                                        <center> 
                                        <br>
                                    <a  class=""><img src="Myndir%203dprent/anextrusion.png" alt="" width= "600" /></a>
                                    </center>
                                <p>
                                    <br>
                
                                <p>
                                    <br>
                                    The pins were made with a simple extrusion, I also added a fillet on the top to smooth the edges. The hook was made with the revolve command, it was revolved 80°.                                     
                                    Then I made the drilling holes. I made four holes, one in each corner. All the diameter d=3mm. Now the design of the object was complete.
                                    <br>    
                                </p>
                                <center> 
                                        <br>
                                    <a  class=""><img src="Myndir%25203dprent/standur2.png" alt="" width= "600" /></a>
                                    </center>
                                 <p>
                            It’s very easy to 3D print when using Fusion. All I had to do was to download the application Ultimaker Cura. Then in Fusion under file I selected 3D print, selected the object and then under print utility I selected Cura. Then once opened the file in Cura I selected the 3D printer and set the settings according to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-hvXZgH76o&ab_channel=Technivorous3dprinting">video </a> that was linked in the project description. Then I “sliced” and Cura told me that the printing process would take 3 hours and 7 minutes.    
                                </p>        
                                    <center> 
                                    <a  class=""><img src="Myndir%203dprent/curasc.png" alt="" width= "800" /></a>
                                    </center>       
                                         
                                <p>
                                <br>
                                Now to print the object is very simple. You just load the sliced Cura file onto a usb stick and plug into the printer. Then you press print, and once the printer has heated up it starts to print. It’s recommended to watch the first few layers to see if everything is going smoothly.
                                </p>

									<h3>Constraints</h3>
								</header>
                                As was stated before, the object was designed with the constraints from the test in mind. The constraints I designed around were as follows:
                                <center>
                                         <p>
                                <b>-</b> Overhang fails after 60°
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                <b>-</b> Holes must be larger than 2mm in diameter
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                <b>-</b> Small extruded triangles might fail
                                </p>
                                </center>
                                <p>
                                For the first constraint I made sure that Cura added a support under the overhang after about 50° so that the hook would print correctly. For the second constraint I simply made sure to make the holes big enough, so I made them the diameter 3mm. And lastly I just made sure that the extruded pins were big enough. They were plenty big, 5mm x 5mm so there was no risk that they might turn out bad. 
                                </p>
                                <header>
									<h3>3D scanning</h3>
								</header>
                                <p>
                                    To do this part of the assignment I used the app Qlone. At first I wanted to expand my experience using Autodesk applications and use Recap Pro from them. However it was only available for Windows and since I have a MacBook that wasn’t an option. <br>
                                    I decided to scan a small statue of an elephant that I found in my living room. I chose it since it had detailed and colorful patterns and a pretty complex geometry. <br>
                                    There is a free version of Qlone and also a paid version. I went with the free version since it offers the feature that I needed (3D scanning) and the only downside I saw was that I could only export the finished result as a picture or a gif. Now once I had downloaded the app the first thing you see is a short tutorial on how to do the 3D scanning which I followed. First I printed out a pattern that I did the scanning on (can be seen on the picture below). I then place the object you wish to scan on top of the paper and start the scan. Once I started the scan, a sort of half globe cut into sections appeared surrounding the object. Then I rotated the piece of paper until I had the entire globe covered.

                                </p>
                                        <br>
                                         <br>
                                         
                                         
                                <br>
                                <div class="row gtr-25">
				                <div class="col-4">

                                <br>
                                         
                                
                                         
                                         
                                <p>
                                         
                                    Then once I had finished the scan the app processed the data, and after a few minutes the finished scan appeared in the app. The scan can be rotated and moved about. I was quite surprised how accurate the results were, given it was a free app and it only took a few minutes for the app to process and make the scan. <br>
                                    The finished product can be seen here below, both in pictures and in a gif.
