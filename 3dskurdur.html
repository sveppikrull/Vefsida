                                    On this page I will be documenting the process I went through when working on project 3 in the course VÉL403G at the University of Iceland. This project was similar to project 2 in the same course but now I was working with a 3D printer rather than a laser cutter. <br>
                                    The first part of the project was to measure a constraint of a 3D printer. A constraint is just a limit on the type of geometry a 3D printer can produce. <br>
                                    The second part of the project was to print an object that could not be manufactured by conventional methods. <br>
                                    And the last part was to scan an object in 3D using a software. <br>
                                    The design files can be found in this <a href=3D%20print%20files.zip>link</a>.

									<h3>3D printing</h3>
								</header>
                                <p>
                                    In this project I will be making an object using a 3D printer. Since I was quite pressed on time I decided to go with a simple design. I have been wanting a stand that I can put my airpod case into while I charge them. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    So the first thing I did was to find out the dimensions of the case. Once I had done that I went straight into Fusion 360 and started designing. My general idea was to have a sphere with a plane cut off the bottom for it to rest on. Then to subtract material where the airpod case could slide in.
                                         </p>  
                                         
                                    <center> 
                                    <br>
                                    <a  class=""><img src="Myndir 3dprent/mynd4.png" alt="" width= "200" /></a>
                                    </center>
                                         <br>
                                         <p>
                                         To do that I first made a sphere in Fusion, then using the techniques I learned from project 2 I made an offset plane from which I could subtract the base. Then I was left with a stand that could stand on its own. 
                                         
                                         </p>
                                         
                                        <center> 
                                        <br>
                                    <a  class=""><img src="Myndir 3dprent/mynd1.png" alt="" width= "600" /></a>
                                    </center>
                                <p>
                                    <br>
                
                                <p>
                                    <br>
                                    The next thing I did was to make an object that was roughly the shape of the airpod case (later on I found out that I made this object too big so the airpod case does not fit snugly into the stand). Once that was done I moved it onto the sphere using an offset plane so that it was slightly slanting as can be seen on the picture below. Then I could subtract it from the sphere.
                                    <br>
                                </p>
                                     <center> 
                                    <a  class=""><img src="Myndir 3dprent/mynd2.png" alt="" width= "800" /></a>
                                    </center>
                                         
                                      <p>
                                    <br>
                                    Then the last thing to do was to subtract space for the charging cable to slide through. I did that in a similar fashion as described before. And then the object was complete and can be seen on the picture below.
                                          <br>
                                    </p>  
                                     <center> 
                                    <a  class=""><img src="Myndir 3dprent/mynd3.png" alt="" width= "800" /></a>
                                    </center>
                                         
                                <p>
                                <br>
                                It’s very easy to 3D print when using Fusion. All I had to do was to download the application Ultimaker Cura. Then in Fusion under file I selected 3D print, selected the object and then under print utility I selected Cura. Then once opened the file in Cura I selected the 3D printer and set the settings according to this <a href="https://valgeir99.github.io/valgeir/3d_printing.html">video </a> that was linked in the project description. Then I “sliced” and Cura told me that the printing process would take 3 hours and 27 minutes. <br>
                                Then when I got to fablab all I had to was upload the sliced Cura file to a USB stick and insert it into the printer and press print. I watched as the printer made the first few layers to make sure everything was going smoothly. Then 3 hours later I came back and the printer had finished printing. The final product can be seen on the pictures below.

									<h3>3D scanning</h3>
								</header>
                                <p>
                                    To do this part of the assignment I used the app Qlone. At first I wanted to expand my experience using Autodesk applications and use Recap Pro from them. However it was only available for Windows and since I have a MacBook that wasn’t an option. <br>
                                    I decided to scan a small statue of an elephant that I found in my living room. I chose it since it had detailed and colorful patterns and a pretty complex geometry. <br>
                                    There is a free version of Qlone and also a paid version. I went with the free version since it offers the feature that I needed (3D scanning) and the only downside I saw was that I could only export the finished result as a picture or a gif. Now once I had downloaded the app the first thing you see is a short tutorial on how to do the 3D scanning which I followed. First I printed out a pattern that I did the scanning on (can be seen on the picture below). I then place the object you wish to scan on top of the paper and start the scan. Once I started the scan, a sort of half globe cut into sections appeared surrounding the object. Then I rotated the piece of paper until I had the entire globe covered.

                                </p>
                                        <br>
                                         <br>
                                         
                                         
                                <br>
                                <div class="row gtr-25">

                                <br>

                                    Then once I had finished the scan the app processed the data, and after a few minutes the finished scan appeared in the app. The scan can be rotated and moved about. I was quite surprised how accurate the results were, given it was a free app and it only took a few minutes for the app to process and make the scan. <br>
                                    The finished product can be seen here below, both in pictures and in a gif.
