									<h3>Project description</h3>
								</header>
                                     <center>
								<p>
									In this project I will be making a website using html. The main purpose of this website will be to host the projects that I will be doing for the course VÉL403G at the University of Iceland.
                                    Further more I want use this opurtunity to make a website that I can use in the future, as a portfolio that can help me when applying to a school or for a job. Therefor I will be trying my best to make the website look as professional as I can with my limited expirience using html.

									<h3>Making the website</h3>
								</header>
                                <p>
                                     Since I have no expirience using html I decided to use a template taken from the website <a href="https://html5up.net/"> https://html5up.net/ </a> to make life easier. At first I chose the template <i>Dimensions</i> as I found the design stunning and the userface was simple. However after having spent some time trying to customize the template I discovered that it was maybe to simple, it lacked templates for different types of pages. Therefor I decided to switched to the template <i>Helios</i> as it had multiple templates for different types of pages and the front page userface was more extensive (had a dropdown feature and more).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Most of the time was spent trying out different things and seeing what bits of code influenced witch part of the site. Once I felt that I knew how things worked I started trimming down the template. It had a lot of things going on at once. My goal was to make the website look professional and simple. So when I felt I had removed all the unnecessary parts I started to perfect the home page. Once I had finished the home page I started working on the other pages. I decided on having the pages: <i>About Me, University of Iceland, Personal Work</i> and <i>Resume</i>.
                                    
                                         </p>
                                         <header>
									<h3>Subpages</h3>
								</header>
                                <p>
                                    On the <i>About Me</i> page I wrote a few paragraphs about myself and my interest and uploded a picture of me. I spent quite alot of time on trying to get the page to look good. I managed to get a look that I am somewhat happy with but I will probably change it in the future when I've gotten more comfortable html.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For the <i>University of Iceland</i> tab I used a dropdown menu where I will link various courses and the big projects I have done. In the dropdown menu there is a link to this course and in particular this project. Furthermore have I linked a few big projects I have done during my studies.
                                </p>
                                         
                                <p>
                                    The <i>Personal Work</i> page is rather empty for the time being. Since I haven't done any big projects on my own time I don't have alot to put on there. So in the meantime I have uploaded a few pictures I have taken over the years. I mainly look at this page as something that I can use in the future.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The <i>Resume</i> tab is just a simple link that pulls up my resume.
                                </p>

									<h3>Uploading the page to github</h3>
								</header>
                                <p>
                                    I have no expirience with github so I followed the instructions laid out on Canvas and got help from my friend Jón Lárus who had already gone through the same process.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>1.</b> First I downloaded and installed <i>Homebrew</i> by following the instructions on <a href="https://brew.sh/">https://brew.sh/</a>.
                                </p>
                                 <p>
                                    <b>2.</b> Then I went on <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com//</a> and made an account and made a repository.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>2.</b> Once I had made a repository I went to the terminal and put directory to the folder where all my html files are stored. Then I pasted code that comes up on the github site. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <center> 
                                    <a  class=""><img src="screenshot1.png" alt="" width= "800" /></a>
                                    </center>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>3.</b> Then I had to put in my username and password from github. Once I had done that 
                                </p>
								
                                    </center>
                                    </center>
